# maripbekoff.github.io
The first project, which i decided to locate on Github Pages.
The main aim is just to get expirience of JavaScript and practice with structure of HTML and CSS code.
So it doesn not contain any helpful information, however i do not care that my site has a open source code.
If you want to join to me, i am always waiting for you. :)
